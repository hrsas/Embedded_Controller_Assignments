Animate both lines with opposite scrolling directions:  
- **Line 1:** “WELCOME to” scrolls **right to left**.  
- **Line 2:** “ETALVIS” scrolls **left to right** continuously.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for dual-direction continuous rotation  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Display wiring details  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation setup file  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446596331025543169)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open project in Wokwi.  
2. Upload `sketch.ino`.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- Top line scrolls **right to left**.  
- Bottom line scrolls **left to right**.  
- Both loop continuously.
