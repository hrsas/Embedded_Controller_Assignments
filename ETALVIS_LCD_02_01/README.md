# Problem 1: Display "WELCOME to" on Line 1, Rotate Left to Right Continuously

**Objective:**  
Display **"WELCOME to"** on **Line 1** of the display and make it **scroll continuously from left to right** in a revolving manner.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for continuous left-to-right rotation  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Display wiring diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation details  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446583272142914561)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload `sketch.ino` to Wokwi.  
2. Verify the display connections as per `diagram.json`.  
3. Run the simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- “WELCOME to” scrolls **from left to right** continuously on **Line 1**.  
- The movement repeats in an infinite loop.
