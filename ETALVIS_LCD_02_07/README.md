# Problem 7: Display "WELCOME to" on Line 1 Staying Middle and "ETALVIS" on Line 2 Rotating Left to Right Continuously

**Objective:**  
Keep **"WELCOME to"** static and centered on **Line 1**, while **"ETALVIS"** scrolls **left to right** continuously on **Line 2**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for static Line 1 and rotating Line 2  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Display wiring diagram  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation metadata  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446596184976705537)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload sketch to Wokwi.  
2. Run the simulation.  
3. Observe both lines.

**Expected Output:**  
- Line 1: “WELCOME to” remains **centered**.
