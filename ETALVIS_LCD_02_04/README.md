# Problem 4: Display "ETALVIS" on Line 2, Rotate Right to Left Continuously

**Objective:**  
Display **"ETALVIS"** on **Line 2** and rotate the text **from right to left** in a continuous revolving pattern.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for right-to-left scrolling  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Display circuit layout  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation configuration  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446595959567424513)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload code to Wokwi.  
2. Connect display as per circuit.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- “ETALVIS” scrolls **from right to left** continuously on **Line 2**.  
- Smooth and repeated rotation effect.
