# Problem 5: Display "WELCOME to" on Line 1 (Middle) and "ETALVIS" on Line 2 Rotating Right to Left Continuously

**Objective:**  
Show **"WELCOME to"** centered on **Line 1**, while **"ETALVIS"** on **Line 2** scrolls **from right to left** continuously.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for static top and rotating bottom text  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Display connection setup  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation data  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446596013673954305)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload sketch into Wokwi.  
2. Run simulation.  
3. Observe both line behaviors.

**Expected Output:**  
- Line 1: “WELCOME to” stays **centered**.  
- Line 2: “ETALVIS” scrolls **right to left** in a loop.
