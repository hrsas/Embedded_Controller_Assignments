# Problem 1: Blink Red LED Every 1 Second Using Timer-1

**Objective:**  
Use **Timer-1** to blink the **Red LED** connected to **Pin 0 of Port A** at a **1-second interval**, without using interrupts.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code to blink Red LED using Timer-1 delay loop  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Wokwi circuit for Port A LED connection  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Simulation configuration and reference  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/PLACEHOLDER_LINK_1)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Open `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load the provided circuit diagram (`diagram.json`).  
3. Run the simulation to view LED blinking at 1-second intervals.

**Expected Output:**  
- The **Red LED** (Pin 0 of Port A) **turns ON for 1s and OFF for 1s** repeatedly.  
- The blinking is achieved using **Timer-1 only**.  
- **No interrupts** are used.
