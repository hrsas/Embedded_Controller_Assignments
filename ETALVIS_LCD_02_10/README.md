# Problem 10: Display "WELCOME to" on Line 1 Rotating Left to Right and "ETALVIS" on Line 2 Rotating Right to Left Continuously

**Objective:**  
Animate both lines with opposing continuous motion:  
- **Line 1:** “WELCOME to” scrolls **left to right**.  
- **Line 2:** “ETALVIS” scrolls **right to left**.

**Files Included:**  
- `src/sketch.ino` → Code for dual-direction text rotation  
- `wokwi/diagram.json` → Display wiring layout  
- `wokwi/wokwi-project.txt` → Wokwi simulation info  

**Simulation Link :**  
[Open in Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/projects/446596388409920513)

**Steps to Run:**  
1. Upload `sketch.ino` in Wokwi.  
2. Load `diagram.json` if required.  
3. Run simulation.

**Expected Output:**  
- Line 1: “WELCOME to” scrolls **left to right** continuously.  
- Line 2: “ETALVIS” scrolls **right to left** continuously.  
- Both operate in infinite loop.
